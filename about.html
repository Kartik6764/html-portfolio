<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Kartik. I am currently studying for Bachelor Tech Degree spacializing in Computer Science Engg. branch.
   As for my hoobies - I love to learn new skills like currently  I am learning Web Developing from Udemy platform.
   After I grasp the knoledge of making web sites U can contact me I would love to serve you the best web site U have
   ever seen.

<p>Other than that I also love to watch movies in my free time. Action and Adventure are my favourite genres.
   I also love to watch animes. I really appretiate the creators of an anime as making an anime is not simple at all.
   And some anime gives us very new ideas which we never get in our surrounding. By the way my most of the new ideas came
   from animes.  </p>
